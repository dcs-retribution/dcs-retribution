description:   "<p>This mission was designed for the We Run Liberation group [WRL].
  <a style=\"color: white\" href=\"https://werunliberation.com\">werunliberation.com</a></p>
  <p>The goal of this mission is to strike at the enemy economy, cripple their finances,
  and take all of the enemy air bases.</p>
  <p>All strike targets (objective buildings) are used to generate income for blufor or redfor. Once destroyed,
  these buildings can not be repaired, even after you capture them. In normal DCS liberation missions,
  destroying these buildings means ruining your future economy.</p><p>In Up The Coast, careful consideration
  has been made for the starting economy of Blufor. You do not need to rely on future captured buildings for income.
  As long as you do not take heavy losses, your starting economy, plus income, should sustain you for the mission.
  Anything captured is a bonus.</p>
  <p>In this mission, it is just as important to kill the economy generating buildings, as it is to kill the enemy
  ground units. The enemy will be able to spend a lot of money replacing units if you do not target the buildings.</p>
  <p>Factory targets are used to produce ground units. Ammo targets are used to dictate how many frontline units can
  be deployed at once. Each airbase has one or more factories. Each airbase has only three ammo targets. Do not
  destroy these if you wish to use them after you capture them</p>"
