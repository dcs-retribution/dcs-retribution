description: "<p>This campaign is the gold standard of WRL campaigns. This campaign will always have the latest retribution additions. Consider this a feature complete campaign as it progresses through updates. Play Battle 4 Gerogia as a beginner mission. Play this one for an advanced experience</p><p>This mission was heavily modified by HolyOrangeJuice [OscarJuliet] for the WRL Group. Join us for weekly PVE events. <a style=\"color: white\" href=\"https://werunliberation.com\">werunliberation.com</a></p><p>Original Battle for Golan Heights by Khopa.</p><p>This modified campaign does not represent any historical time period or events. Attack from Ramat-David and eliminate the enemy around Damascus.</p><p>All WRL Campaigns use high budget and high income to focus on the PVE goals to eliminate the enemy. Use lower starting money and income for increased difficulty.</p>"
