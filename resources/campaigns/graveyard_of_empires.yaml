description:
  <p>Following the 9/11 attacks, the United States and its NATO allies launched a 
  full-scale invasion of Afghanistan to dismantle the Taliban regime and root out 
  Al-Qaeda. As the conflict progressed, Russia grew increasingly concerned that the 
  Western powers were using the War on Terror as a pretext for territorial expansion 
  in Central Asia. The Kremlin viewed NATO's growing presence in Afghanistan as a 
  direct threat to its sphere of influence and a potential encroachment on its 
  southern borders.</p>
  <p>Shortly after the fall of Kandahar, which signalled the end of organised Taliban 
  control of Afghanistan, Russia and a coalition of its allies with historical ties 
  to the Soviet Union decided to intervene under the guise of protecting regional 
  stability and sovereignty. While Russia did not openly ally with the insurgents, 
  it covertly provided logistical support, intelligence, and military aid to 
  various anti-NATO factions within Afghanistan as part of a broader strategy to 
  prevent NATO forces from gaining a foothold in the region.</p>
  <p>The conflict quickly escalated into a multi-faceted and very costly war. The 
  United States and its allies found themselves not only battling insurgents but 
  also facing direct confrontations with increasing numbers of conventional 
  Russian forces both in the air and on the ground. The ferocity of the war 
  underscored once more the peril of foreign intervention in this historically 
  unyielding land.</p>
