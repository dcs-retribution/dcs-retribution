description:
  <p>The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) has been actively 
  monitoring the ceasefire agreement between Georgia and its breakaway region 
  of Abkhazia. However, recent developments have escalated tensions, leading 
  to a precarious situation for the UN observers. Along with a small contingent 
  of international troops, they have found themselves isolated due to the 
  intervention of Russian forces supporting Abkhazia's separatist ambitions. 
  The UNOMIG headquarters in Sukhumi has fallen into enemy hands, leaving a 
  small group based at the Zugdidi Sector Headquarters facing the daunting 
  task of navigating to safety with the aid of close air support.</p>
  <p>The immediate goal is to orchestrate a strategic withdrawal of UN forces to 
  the coastline, leveraging support from US naval aircraft positioned offshore 
  as well as US Air force squadrons newly arrived at Tbilisi. Commanders may opt 
  to begin the operation with light vehicles, employing breakthrough tactics to 
  avoid direct confrontations with enemy forces. Alternatively, the use of 
  heavier ground units is an option for commanders seeking a more conventional 
  combat engagement. C-17 Globemasters stand ready bring in additional ground 
  units from Incirlik to reinforce existing troops, upon recapture of Sukhumi.</p>
