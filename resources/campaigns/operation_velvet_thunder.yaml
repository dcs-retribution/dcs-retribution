description:
  <p>Operation Velvet Thunder is a high-intensity training exercise designed to 
  prepare fresh troops for the challenges they will face in Vietnam. The dense 
  jungle and rugged terrain of the Mariana Islands will provide a realistic 
  backdrop, allowing our forces to hone essential skills in jungle warfare, 
  unconventional tactics, and counterinsurgency operations. There are multiple 
  checkpoints scattered across the area of operations that will have to be 
  captured by Air Assault. Due to the limited size and availability of LZs, it 
  is vital to pay close attention to where you designate troop drop off zones.
  </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This campaign is intended to be played with the 
  A-4 Skyhawk, OV-10A, and C-130J aircraft mods active. The C-101CC has also 
  been included as a stand-in for the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly in order to provide 
  a CAS platform of roughly equivalent combat capability.</p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Airbase threat range should be set to 25 for this campaign.
