  <a style=\"color: white\" href=\"https://werunliberation.com\">werunliberation.com</a></p>
  <p>The invasion of Georgia has begun. Russian forces have pushed all the way up to Zugdidi.
  NATO has decided to help Georgia out and push Russia back towards Sochi. The Abraham Lincoln was dispatched
  by the US to support NATO's efforts to help Georgia, along with the Saipan. Georgia has also allowed NATO
  aircraft to make use of Georgian airfields for its defence. The objective is simple, liberate Georgia
  from its Russian neighbours before it's too late!
