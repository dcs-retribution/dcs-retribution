description:
    <p>In this semi-historical scenario set during the early stages of the 
    Yom Kippur War, Egypt has successfully captured extensive territory 
    across the Sinai Peninsula during the initial surprise attack. 
    Operation Gazelle represents a critical Israeli counter-offensive to 
    reclaim these areas. Supported by armoured brigades, paratrooper units, 
    and air cover, Israeli forces are tasked with driving the Egyptian Third 
    Army back across the Al Salam Bridge. Their mission also involves encircling 
    and cutting off the Egyptian forces that are advancing eastward from the 
    Port Tewfik Pontoon Bridge through the Mitla and Gidi mountain passes. This 
    operation aims to decisively shift the war's momentum, re-establishing 
    Israeli dominance in the crucial Sinai region.</p>
