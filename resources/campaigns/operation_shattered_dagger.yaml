description:
  <p>In the spring of 2006, insurgents initiated a well-coordinated offensive in southern Afghanistan, 
  focusing their efforts on the strategically vital provinces of Helmand and Kandahar. Insurgent 
  operations extended beyond small skirmishes, including major assaults on multiple Forward Operating 
  Bases (FOBs) that were crucial for coalition operations. The loss or isolation of these bases would 
  have significantly hindered NATO forces' ability to maintain control in the region, severely impacting 
  the overall stability and security of the region.</p>
  <p>With multiple FOBs under siege and cut off from friendly forces, the situation for the coalition 
  troops became increasingly dire. In response to these attacks, Apache and Kiowa Warrior helicopters were 
  tasked with providing close air support, targeting insurgent positions, and neutralising enemy forces 
  surrounding the FOBs. Once cleared of enemy forces, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters can then deliver 
  much needed reinforcements and supplies to coalition troops.</p>
