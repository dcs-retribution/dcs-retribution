description: <p>1968 fictional recreation of the Vietnam war. US Navy carriers are on station on the gulf in denominated "Yankee Station" area and will support ground troops progressing towards Saigon. Supported from Laos and Cambodia through the famous "Ho Chi Minh Trail" B-52s from Tahiland and Guam will help with saturation bombardments if available. Co-In missios can be flown with Broncos in the forest canyons and - of course - full action from the carriers will be done by Phantoms, Intruders and Skyhawks.
