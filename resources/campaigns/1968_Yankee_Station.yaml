description: <p>1968 fictional recreation of the Vietnam war. US Navy carriers are on station on the gulf in denominated "Yankee Station" area and will support ground troops progressing towards Saigon.

Co-In missios can be flown with Broncos in the forest canyons and - of course - full action from the carriers will be done by Phantoms, Intruders and Skyhawks.
