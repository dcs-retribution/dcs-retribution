description:
  <p>The year is 2016. The world watches with bated breath as NATO's expansion eastward stokes the flames of conflict with Russia. Under the iron rule of President Nikolai Zakharov, the Kremlin perceives this encroachment as a direct threat to its national security and a relic of Cold War hostilities.</p>
  <p>Finland, a neutral nation sharing a vast border with Russia, becomes the focal point of this geopolitical chess match. Its potential accession to NATO would significantly bolster the alliance's presence on Russia's doorstep, a prospect Zakharov views as intolerable.</p>
  <p>In June of 2016, amidst swirling rumors and escalating tensions, whispers of secret NATO expansion talks involving Finland reach the Kremlin. Zakharov, fearing imminent encirclement, makes a decisive and ruthless move. Under the cover of darkness, Russian forces launch a swift and brutal invasion, catching the Finnish military off guard.</p>
  <p>Within days, Russian armored divisions and airborne troops seize control of a significant portion of Lapland, a strategic region rich in natural resources and bordering key NATO member, Norway. The world is stunned by the brazen aggression, and the once neutral Finland finds itself thrust into the center of a new global conflict.</p>
