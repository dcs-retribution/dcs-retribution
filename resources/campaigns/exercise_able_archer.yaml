description:
  <p>In 1983, during the height of the Cold War, tensions escalate to 
  a breaking point as the Soviet Union, misinterpreting NATO's Able 
  Archer 83 exercise as a genuine mobilisation for a surprise nuclear 
  attack, decides to launch a pre-emptive conventional strike. On the 
  9th of November, Soviet forces commence a sudden invasion of Norway, 
  aiming to secure strategic territories and disrupt NATO's northern 
  flank before it can organize an effective response.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously, the Soviet Union extends its offensive to include 
  Finland and Sweden. Although officially neutral, these nations are 
  perceived as potential staging grounds for NATO reinforcements and 
  supply lines. The Soviet high command believes that controlling 
  these territories will prevent NATO from using their airspace and 
  ports to launch counterattacks or obtain logistical support.</p>
  <p>As Soviet forces push across the borders, NATO and its new allies 
  must swiftly mobilise to defend their territories. The battle quickly 
  expands into a broader conflict, with both sides aiming to gain 
  control of critical regions. The ultimate objective for NATO and its 
  allies becomes clear. They must push eastward to the Kola Peninsula 
  to neutralise the Soviet threat and restore stability to Northern Europe.</p>
