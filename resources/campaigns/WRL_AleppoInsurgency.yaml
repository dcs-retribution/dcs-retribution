Join us for weekly PVE events. <a style=\"color: white\" href=\"https://werunliberation.com\">werunliberation.com</a></p><p>This campaign does not represent any historical time period or events. It was designed as an exciting helicopter campaign. The enemy has no air support or frontline. Fixed wing can assist with precision strikes</p><p>Use the Air Assault task with CTLD to land troops for capturing points.</p><p>All WRL Campaigns use high budget and high income to focus on the PVE goals to eliminate the enemy. Use lower starting money and income for increased difficulty.</p>"
