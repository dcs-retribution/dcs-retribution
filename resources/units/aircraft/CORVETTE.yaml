description:
  "The Raider-class corvette was a sleek and roomy vessel at 150 meters for a sizeable crew and featured 3 engines and a
    hyperdrive. The dark grey protrusions on the craft were actually solar collectors, nearly identical to those found on
    the starfighters of the TIE-series. These ships could be operated with a pilot and a co-pilot and were armed with
    ion cannons, dual heavy laser cannons, concussion missiles, and turbolasers.[5] The ships also had a small hangar 
    on the starboard side, that could hold at least 2 TIE fighters"
