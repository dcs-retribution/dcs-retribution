description:
  The F-15 has often been labeled as the greatest U.S. fighter aircraft
  from the 1970s until the early 21st century. The F-15C is a pure fighter with outstanding
  performance and has scored over 100 air-to-air victories without suffering any confirmed
  losses.

  The "Baz" is an Israeli modification of the F-15, allowing it to carry both Python missiles as well as
  the I-Derby made by Rafael Defence Industries. It also allowed the F-15 to carry out strike missions,
  effectively making it a multi-rule fighter. With the addition of CFTs, the Baz' operational range is also extended.
