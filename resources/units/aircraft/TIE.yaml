  "The TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, also known as the TIE/LN starfighter or TIE/ln starfighter 
    and commonly called the TIE fighter or simply the TIE/ln, was the signature starfighter of the Galactic 
    Empire and de facto symbol of it space superiority. Its official production name was the Twin Ion Engine
    line edition space superiority starfighter. Instantly recognizable from the roar of its engines as well as 
    its unique design, the TIE/ln exuded Imperial power and prestige across the galaxy, seeing use throughout
