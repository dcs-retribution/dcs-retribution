description:
  "The TIE/IN interceptor[15] or TIE/in[16] was a far deadlier opponent than the standard TIE/ln space superiority
    starfighter and featured four very recognizable pointed solar panels.[6] These panels, based on the bent-wing
    configuration used on the prototype TIE Advanced flown by Darth Vader, were given a dagger like design, which gave 
    a TIE fighter pilot a wider field of vision"
