  The MB-339 was developed during the 1970s in response to an Italian Air Force requirement that sought a replacement
  for the service's existing fleet of Aermacchi MB-326s. Its design was derived from that of the MB-326, rather than
  a new design, and thus the two aircraft share considerable similarities in terms of their design. Aermacchi had
  found that the MB-339 was capable of satisfying all of the specified requirements while being the most affordable
  option available. The maiden flight of the MB-339 took place on 12 August 1976; the first production aircraft were
  delivered two years later.

    # The common allocator is sufficient for Liberation's purposes. There are
    # more than 20 channels available on COMM2 (manual says 100, ME says 30,
    # presumably only 30 can be truly *pre* set, and the other 70 can be set in
    # the cockpit). We never need that many though, so no sense customizing
    # further.

    # COMM1 us UHF only. COMM2 is V/UHF. We prefer allocating intra-flight on
    # VHF because it's less contested, so intra-flight goes to COMM2.
