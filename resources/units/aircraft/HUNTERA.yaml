description:
  "The Twin ion engine Hunter was an Imperial starfighter which had a wing configuration roughly the reverse
   of a TIE/IN interceptor. Similar to the T-65 X-wing starfighter, the TIE Hunter possessed S-foils, 
   which meant that they would open in attack mode and close in normal flight. This was largely because
    the TIE Hunters were created by the Galactic Empire specifically as a means to counter the T-65 X-wing 
    starfighter. Unlike most other contemporary TIEs of the time, TIE Hunters were equipped with a hyperdrive
    and shields, making them more valuable than most starfighters the Empire utilized. Because of these 
    characteristics, it was also considered to be the fastest TIE variant among the Imperial fleet.[2] When 
    the S-foils were closed, the craft could not fire its weapons"
