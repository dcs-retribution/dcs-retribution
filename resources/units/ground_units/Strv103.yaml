class: Tank
description: The Stridsvagn 103 (Strv 103), also known as the S-tank, is a Swedish
  post-World War II main battle tank, designed and manufactured in Sweden. Developed
  in the 1950s, it was the first main battle tank to use a gas turbine engine and
  the only mass-produced tank since World War II to dispense with a turret besides
  the German Kanonenjagdpanzer. It has an unconventional design with a unique gun
  laying process. It is turretless with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks
  and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. The result was a very low-profile
  design with an emphasis on survivability and heightened crew protection level.
